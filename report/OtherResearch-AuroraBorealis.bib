abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The Solid-State Imaging (SSI) instrument provided the first high- and medium-resolution views of Io as the Galileo spacecraft closed in on the volcanic body in late 1999 and early 2000. While each volcanic center has many unique features, the majority can be placed into one of two broad categories. The “Promethean” eruptions, typified by the volcanic center Prometheus, are characterized by long-lived steady eruptions producing a compound flow field emplaced in an insulating manner over a period of years to decades. In contrast, “Pillanian” eruptions are characterized by large pyroclastic deposits and short-lived but high effusion rate eruptions from fissures feeding open-channel or open-sheet flows. Both types of eruptions commonly have ∼100-km-tall, bright, SO2-rich plumes forming near the flow fronts and smaller deposits of red material that mark the vent for the silicate lavas.},

The algorithm$\backslash$nis based on the current understanding of the physical origin of the$\backslash$naurora. This natural display is mainly caused by high-energy electrons$\backslash$noriginating in the Sun and entering the Earth's atmosphere in narrow$\backslash$nregions centered on the magnetic poles. These electrons collide with$\backslash$natmospheric atoms which are excited to higher energy levels. The excited$\backslash$natoms emit rapidly varying visible light in a curtain-like volume as$\backslash$nthey return to lower energy levels thereby creating the aurora. By$\backslash$nsimulating these light emissions along with the spatial and temporal$\backslash$ndistribution of the entering electrons, we are able to render the major$\backslash$nvisual aspects of auroral displays. This approach also allows the$\backslash$nrepresentation of time-dependent features that characterize the dynamic$\backslash$nnature of the aurorae.

abstract = {The great geomagnetic storm of 1859 is really composed of two closely spaced massive worldwide auroral events. The first event began on August 28th and the second began on September 2nd. It is the storm on September 2nd that results from the Carrington-Hodgson white light flare that occurred on the sun September 1st. In addition to published scientific measurements; newspapers, ship logs, and other records of that era provide an untapped wealth of first hand observations giving time and location along with reports of the auroral forms and colors. At its height, the aurora was described as a blood or deep crimson red that was so bright that one "could read a newspaper by". Several important aspects of this great geomagnetic storm are simply phenomenal. Auroral forms of all types and colors were observed to geographic latitudes of 25?? and lower. Significant portions of the world's 125,000 miles of telegraph lines were also adversely affected. Many of which were unusable for 8 h or more and had a small but notable economic impact. This paper presents only a select few available first hand accounts of the Great Auroral Event of 1859 in an attempt to give the modern reader a sense of how this spectacular display was received by the public from many places around the globe and present some other important historical aspects of the storm. ?? 2006 COSPAR.},

abstract = {Simulating natural phenomena has always been a focal point for computer graphics research. Its importance goes beyond the production of appealing presentations, since research in this area can contribute to the scientific understanding of complex natural processes. The natural phenomena, known as the Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis, are geomagnetic phenomena of impressive visual characteristics and remarkable scientific interest. Aurorae present a complex behavior that arises from interactions between plasma (hot, ionized gases composed of ions, electrons, and neutral atoms) and Earth's electromagnetic fields. Previous work on the visual simulation of auroral phenomena have focused on static physical models of their shape, modeled from primitives, like sine waves. In this article, we focus on the dynamic behavior of the aurora, and we present a physically-based model to perform 3D visual simulations. The model takes into account the physical parameters and processes directly associated with plasma flow, and can be extended to simulate the dynamics of other plasma phenomena as well as astrophysical phenomena. The partial differential equations associated with these processes are solved using a complete multigrid implementation of the electromagnetic interactions, leading to a simulation of the shape and motion of the auroral displays. In order to illustrate the applicability of our model, we provide simulation sequences rendered using a distributed forward mapping approach. © 2005 ACM.},

abstract = {Observations of the trailing hemisphere of Io made with the Faint Object Spectrograph of the Hubble Space Telescope in March 1992 have resulted in the first detection of atmospheric {\{}SO2{\}} absorption bands in the ultraviolet. These observations represent only the third positive means of detection of what is widely believed to be Io's primary atmospheric constituent. Below ∼2130 {\AA}the geometric albedo of the satellite is dominated by {\{}SO2{\}} gas absorption band signatures, which have been analyzed using models that include the effects of optical thickness, temperature, and spatial distribution. The disk-integrated {\{}HST{\}} data cannot resolve the spatial distribution, but it is possible to define basic properties and set constraints on the atmosphere at the time of the observations, Hemispheric atmospheres with average column density N = 6-10 × 1015 cm-2 and Tgas = 110-500 K fit the data, with preference for temperatures of ∼200-250 K. Better fits are found as the atmosphere is spatially confined, with a limit of ∼8{\%} hemispheric areal coverage and N ≈ 3 × 1017 cm-2 with colder 110-250 K temperatures. A dense (N ≥1016 cm-2), localized component of {\{}SO2{\}} gas, such ns that possibly associated with active volcanoes, can generate the observed spectral contrast only when the atmosphere is cold (110 K) and an extended component such as Pele is included. The combination of a dense, localized atmosphere with a tenuous component (N < 1016 cm-2 either patchy or extended) also fits the data. In all cases the best fit models imply a disk-averaged column density larger than exospheric but ∼10-30 times less than the previous upper limit from near-UV observations.},

After an introductory chapter that explores what it means to be nonlinear, the book covers the mathematical concepts such as limit cycles, fractals, chaos, bifurcations, and solitons, that will be applied throughout the book. Numerous computer simulations and exercises allow students to explore topics in greater depth using the Maple computer algebra system. The mathematical level of the text assumes prior exposure to ordinary differential equations and familiarity with the wave and diffusion equations. No prior knowledge of Maple is assumed.

abstract = {All-sky spectral imagery has been used to study the altitude distribution of OII(732–733 nm), OI(630 nm), and N2(1PG) emissions in tall auroral rays appearing at the poleward edge of the auroral oval. The OII(732–733 nm) emission layer was consistently higher than the OI(630 nm) emission layer in these structures; the peak emission altitudes were estimated to be ∼380 km and ∼240 km, respectively. Neither the high absolute altitude of the OII(732–733 nm) peak nor its >100 km offset from the OI(630 nm) peak are consistent with published model results, which consider electron impact on atomic oxygen as the sole source of auroral O+(2P). The present results suggest that O+(2P) may also be excited directly from ambient ionospheric O+(4S) atoms. Other contributing factors may include a significant underestimation of the rate coefficients for O+(2P) quenching, or field-aligned up-flows of ionospheric O+.},

abstract = {Optical observations of the aurora have traditionally focused on the$\backslash$nstructure, intensity, and wavelength of the emissions. But the apparent$\backslash$nmotion of auroral forms offers another important diagnostic tool$\backslash$nfor investigating this poorly understood phenomenon. Prior analyses$\backslash$nof auroral motion have focused on tracing individual features. In$\backslash$nthis letter, we investigate the feasibility of deriving the entire$\backslash$ntwo-dimensional velocity field automatically using robust optical$\backslash$nflow estimation. The analysis is applied to two narrow-field video$\backslash$nsequences. Both examples are rich in small-scale structure and motion,$\backslash$nbut appear very different to the eye. The robust optical flow estimator$\backslash$nperformed well for regions of dense turbulent motion, while sheared$\backslash$nflow, and flow which is perpendicular to image intensity gradients,$\backslash$nwas poorly resolved. The relative magnitude of the outliers provides$\backslash$na quantitative measure of the validity of the underlying flow model$\backslash$nand, hence, a means of automatically differentiating among auroral$\backslash$nforms with differing physical origins.},

@article{Roth2014,
abstract = {We have carried out a comprehensive analysis of a large set of spatially resolved observations of Io's OI 1304. ??, OI] 1356. ??, SI 1479. ?? and SI] 1900. ?? aurora taken by the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) between 1997 and 2001. We find that the variability of the observed morphologies can be solely explained by the changes of the plasma and magnetic field environment of the Io torus and by the viewing perspective. The variations in brightness are strongly correlated with the periodic variations of the ambient electron density. Based on these findings we develop a phenomenological model for the spatial distribution of the oxygen and sulfur emissions in Io's vicinity. Taking into account Io's position with respect to the plasma torus, the orientation of Jupiter's magnetic field and the viewing perspective of the observation, the model calculates the auroral morphology and brightness. By fitting the model parameters to the observations we find that the model is able to reproduce the main features in all images obtained over a period of five years with one parameter set for each emission multiplet. The spatial distribution of the OI] 1356. ??, OI 1304. ??, SI 1479. ??, and SI] 1900. ?? multiplets are shown to be very similar. In contrast to previous investigations, the model results reveal that the majority of the radiation from the bound atmosphere is emitted within 100. km above the surface. The equatorial aurora spots extend far into the wake region explaining observed features in the downstream region. The relative brightness of two the equatorial spots is best explained by our model if the emission on the day-side flank of Io is higher by a factor of {\~{}}1.5 with respect to the nightside flank. The measured brightness during an observation in eclipse is significantly lower than expected from the fitted model. The day-night asymmetry and the brightness decrease in eclipse support the idea of a wide collapse of Io's atmosphere in shadow. Since our phenomenological aurora model is able to reproduce the main features of the observed morphology by taking into account the variations of the magnetospheric parameters, it can be applied to predict the emission for future UV aurora observations for a given time and position of the observer. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},
