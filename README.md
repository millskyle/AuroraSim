# AuroraSim


_An agent-based approach to simulating the dynamics of the aurora is presented. We combine a dynamic agent-based model with a stochastic Monte Carlo approach to reproduce the dynamics of the aurora.  We investigate the consistency between our model and some physically observable characteristics of the aurora. Finally, we extend our model to other planetary aurora, specifically Jupiter's moon Io._
